					<h2>Project Rousseau</h2>
					<p>
						Project Rousseau empowers youth in communities with the greatest 
						need to reach their full potential and pursue higher education. 
						They aim to do this with their four pillars: mentoring, academics, 
						community service, and broadening horizons. I have volunteered to 
						lead a class and have a wonderful mentee I hope to help as much as 
						possible.

					<h2>Magner Center</h2>
					<p>
					Magner Center is the career center at Brooklyn College, they 
					offer resources for students to excel at their career and gain 
					experience in their field. They have many useful workshops and 
					events throughout the year. I have helped them out in many of 
					these events and continue to do so whenever I can.
					</p>

					<h2>Magner Center Ambassador</h2>
					<p>
						As a Magner Center Ambassador, I greeted and helped students,
						and professionals, answered phone calls, assisted set up for
						events, signed in studens, and administrative tasks like 
						creating flyers. This was my first formal work experience in 
						and I enjoyed it as I improved my communication, and met many 
						wonderful people. I also enjoyed all the advice I recieved at 
						the events and from the conversations at the Magner Center. 
					</p>						
					<h2>Website Devloper Intenship</h2>
					<p>
						Summer 2017, I spent 6 weeks rebuilding Brooklyn Bark's 
						website. I used Wordpress, as a content management system,
						and coded mainly in SCSS and sometimes PHP. This experience 
						exposed me to working in teams where I improved my communication 
						and learned new tools. I feel more comfortable making responsive 
						website quickly.

					<h2>Co Director of WICS Mentorship Initiative</h2>
					<p>
						The intention of this program is to provide our members with a 
						network of professionals in the field who have faced the same 
						challenges they are facing and build a support group to keep 
						anyone who identifies as a woman to stay in tech and pursue a 
						successful career.
