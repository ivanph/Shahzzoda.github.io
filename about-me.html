				<h1>About me:</h1>
				<hr>
				<hr class="lower-hr">
				<p>I'm a rising sophomore at Brooklyn College pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. 
					I love to learn things and I want to improve the world's condition. I volunteer as much as I can, study often,
					and take care of my three younger siblings as well as support my friends. Most of my volunteering 
					is short term but I plan to volunteer with Project Rousseau, and the Magner Career Center for as long as I can.

					You can learn more about my volunteering under <a href="experiences.html">experiences</a>. I care deeply about educational 
					and economic empowerment, as well as micromoments of kindness we can all take. I'm grateful for the Brooklyn College 
					communities and all the people I have met on campus.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>The clubs I'm a part of:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Computer Science Club</li>
						<li>Women in Computer Science Club</li>
						<li>Math Club</li>
						<li>Toastmaster International Club</li>
						<li>Yearbook Club</li>
					</ul> 
					<p>I also occasionally write for the Night Call on topics that interest me.</p>
