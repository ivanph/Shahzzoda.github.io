				<h1>About me:</h1>
				<hr>
				<hr class="lower-hr">
				<p>I'm a rising sophomore at Brooklyn College pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. 
					I love to learn things and I want to improve the world's condition. I volunteer as much as I can, work as 
					web developer, and take care of my three younger siblings as well as support my friends. Most of my volunteering 
					is short term but I plan to volunteer with Project Rousseau, and RailsBridgeNYC for as long as I can.

					You can learn more about my volunteering under <a>experiences</a>. I care deeply about education 
					and empowerment, as well as micromoments of kindness we can all take. I'm grateful for the Brooklyn College 
					community and all the people I have met on campus.</p>
